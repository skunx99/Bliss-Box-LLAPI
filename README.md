# Bliss-Box-LLAPI
For demonstraiting the LLAPI 

This code shows how the LLAPI protocal is read and sent back out. Loading the data and dealing with flags is optional. 
It is inteneded to be included in to a project looking to comunicate with LLAI.

Two projects use this code thus far. Bliss-Box adaptors found at bliss-box.net and the MiSTer core fork that interfaces with the BlisSTer. 
The MiSTer cores can be found here.  https://github.com/MiSTer-LLAPI
